## Java Tricks Questions

- Can you override a private or static method in Java?
- What will happen if you put a return statement or `System.exit()` into a `try`
  or `catch` block? Will the `finally` block execute?
- What will the expression `1.0 / 0.0` return? Will it throw an Exception? Any
  compile time error?
- Does Java support multiple inheritance?
- What is the issue with the following implementation of the `compareTo()`
  method in Java?

  ```java
  private int id;

  public int compareTo(Object o){
    Employee emp = (Employee) o;
    return this.id - e.id;
  }
  ```

  ```java
  String s = new String("abc");
  ```

- What is the difference between `final`, `finalize` and `finally`?
- How does Garbage Collection prevent a Java application from going out of
  memory?
- `int a = 1L;` Won’t compile and `int b = 0; b += 1L;` compiles fine. Why?
- Is Empty .java file name a valid source file name?
- What is the default value of the local variables?
- Can you use `this()` and `super()` both in a constructor?
- What's the difference between method overloading and overriding?
- Is it possible to instantiate an abstract class?
- Is it possible to instantiate an interface?
- What is the return type of this method?

  ```java
  public abstract int[] foo(int[] arg)[][][][][][][][][][][];
  ```

### What gets printed out?

```java
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(Math.min(Double.MIN_VALUE, 0.0d));
  }
}
```

```java
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    char[] chars = new char[] {'\u0097'};
    String str = new String(chars);
    byte[] bytes = str.getBytes(); System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bytes));
  }
}
```

```java
final double d = 1 / 2;
System.out.println(d);
```

```java
final List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

list.add(1);
list.add(2);
list.add(3);

list.remove(2);
System.out.println(list);
```

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer a = 1000, b = 1000;
        System.out.println(a == b);

        Integer c = 100, d = 100;
        System.out.println(c == d);
    }
}
```

```java
public static void main() {
  int x = 1;
  methodTwo(x);
  System.out.println(x);
}

public static void methodTwo(int i) {
  i++;
}
```

### Java WAT

```java
Object o = true ? 'a' : new Float(1);
System.out.println(o);
System.out.println(o.getClass());
```

```java
int[] a = { , };
System.out.println(a.length);
```

```java
public class Foo {
    public static String wat(String arg) {
        return arg + arg;
    }
}

Foo myFoo = null;
System.out.println(myFoo.wat("wat"));
```

```java
System.out.println("a.b.c".replace(".", "/"));
System.out.println("a.b.c".replaceAll(".", "/"));
```
